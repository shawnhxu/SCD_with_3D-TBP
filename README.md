# Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-Total Body Photography (3D-TBP)
By: Shawn Xu

This was my attempt at the `ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP` competition hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) found on Kaggle. The instructions, guidelines, and dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge). 

## Abstract

Detecting skin cancer early is crucial for immediate dermatologic care. In this project, I hope to employ AI and machine learning models in order to distinguish benign skin lesions and malignant ones. There was a lot of help and research done by other participants in the tournament that enabled me to employ my own ideas on top of their foundational work. Thank you to all other participants for the help!

My work is split into 4 notebooks:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations](https://github.com/shawnhxu/SCD_with_3D-TBP/blob/main/notebook/eda-dataaug.ipynb)
- [Convolutional Neural Network Training on Image Data](https://github.com/shawnhxu/SCD_with_3D-TBP/blob/main/notebook/cnn1.ipynb)
- [Decision Tree Training on Tabular Data](https://github.com/shawnhxu/SCD_with_3D-TBP/blob/main/notebook/tabular.ipynb)
- [Ensembling All Trained Models](https://github.com/shawnhxu/SCD_with_3D-TBP/blob/main/notebook/ensemble.ipynb)


__Personal Note:__
While I did not submit my final notebook into the competition, I believe with enough fervor, incentive, and time I would be able to develop an even better model with even better results. For now, I decided to do this to expand my repertoire of machine learning techniques. This competition allowed me to learn and practice these techniques for a real, practical application.
